# Mono Clicker DX
a public source code for the satire clicker game made in Ren'Py called Mono Clicker DX

## disclaimer
some code (and assets) are shared from the main game called [Time Will Travel](https://hananezumi.itch.io/timewilltravel), because it was included there as a prototype. most of the assets that are from the main game will be obselete due to them being unusuable or has no purpose to be here anyways (only this one is open source, Time Will Travel is personal sourced by me)

this public source code is what you consider on how to make a simple (but confusing) clicker game inside Ren'Py, but i don't know why i did it anyway

## FAQ
> "kyotani, there is no license in this source code. how am i supposed to follow the licensing rules?"

obviously there is no license, meaning you can just fork it with your OWN code and your OWN free will, except the plugins; because those are the ones that I DO NOT own, but are modifiable if you just apply the applicable fields in the plugin code, such as the `discord.application_id` definition in the `rich_presence_settings.rpy` file for example (meaning no commits on the plugin frontends unless i do it)

> "why is it even here? you looking for optimization?"

yes and no. i wanted to publish this code as it doesn't have any spoiler value to the main story. the original game (Time Will Travel) is an absolute code spaghetti even myself don't want to publish it anyway
