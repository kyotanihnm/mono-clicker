# Mono Clicker DX
a public source code for the satire clicker game made in Ren'Py called Mono Clicker DX

> "A game that was made out of boredom. I just can't stand and wait for somebody without my fixation." - Mono Kuroko, First Class Starguard

## disclaimer
some code (and assets) are shared from the main game called [Time Will Travel](https://hananezumi.itch.io/timewilltravel), because it was included there as a prototype. most of the assets that are from the main game will be obselete due to them being unusuable or has no purpose to be here anyways (only this one is open source, Time Will Travel is personal sourced by me)

this public source code is what you consider on how to make a simple (but confusing) clicker game inside Ren'Py, but i don't know why i did it anyway

## FAQ
### "kyotani, there is no license in this source code. how am i supposed to follow the licensing rules?"

obviously there is no license, meaning you can just fork it with your OWN code and your OWN free will, except the plugins; because those are the ones that I DO NOT own, but are modifiable if you just apply the applicable fields in the plugin code, such as the `discord.application_id` definition in the `rich_presence_settings.rpy` file for example (meaning no commits on the plugin frontends unless i do it or the plugin developers updated a new one)

### "how can i download the source code, help me with this problem, kyotani"

just download it by pressing the green Code button then Download ZIP. after that, extract and place the extracted folder where you would store your Ren'Py projects, atleast if you already have the [Ren'Py SDK](https://renpy.org) downloaded first. we do not release the base game here other than itch.io, mind you :sweat_smile:

### "why is it a satire clicker?"

aside from it being a satire clicker game, there is a lot of jokes and memes revolving with that. it's not something serious like any other incremental games :wink:

### "some files aren't in here than what i've saw in the base game. why is that?"

there are differences here. this is a public source code with ready-to-go assets, and a base game with a lot of sounds and images. obviously, this is more targetted for forkers, not something that i would publish the entirety of it :confused:

### "where do plugins/addons go?"

`game/plugins`, but some other required files for the plugins/addons might be in the `game` folder

### "wiki page. where is it, kyotani?"

not yet, i'm still figuring it out on how you can create yours :confused: (without parsing errors, that is)

### "who is Mono Kuroko on the top of the quote, and why is that named after a game name?"

https://hananezumi.miraheze.org/wiki/Mono_Kuroko < (you might be looking for this :slightly_smiling_face:)

### "why is it even here? you looking for optimization?"

yes and no. i wanted to publish this code as it doesn't have any spoiler value to the main story. the original game (Time Will Travel) is an absolute code spaghetti even myself don't want to publish it anyway :wink:
