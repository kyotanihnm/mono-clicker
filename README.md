# mono-clicker
a public source code for the satire clicker game made in Ren'Py called Mono Clicker DX

some code (and assets) are shared from the main game called [Time Will Travel](https://hananezumi.itch.io/timewilltravel), because it was included there a prototype. most of the assets that are from the main game will be obselete due to them being unusuable or has no purpose to be here anyways

this public source code is what you consider on how to make a simple (but confusing) clicker game inside Ren'Py, but i don't know why i did it anyway
